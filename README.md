God Loves You!

 Here's a simple website for you to practice with. I made it as practice for myself, and though there might be some other new code enthusiast that could use a bit of reference. I'm using three files html, css, and javascript. I did this so I could practice with the actual code in different places, rather than one document.

 If your new to code pay attention to what you name stuff, it got a bit confusing using three sheets, but don't worry you got this!

 If your a seasoned pro, feel free to pull and add on to the code. Any contributions to help us newbies learn are much appreciated.
